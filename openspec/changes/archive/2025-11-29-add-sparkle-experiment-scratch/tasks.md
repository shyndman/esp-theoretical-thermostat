- [x] Create `scratch/sparkle/` with a README covering the scratch policy, Arduino/FastLED setup, and clarifying that ESP-IDF builds ignore the folder (now updated for the DFRobot FireBeetle 2 ESP32-P4 using Espressif's `esp32:esp32:esp32p4` board profile).
- [x] Implement `scratch/sparkle/sparkle.ino` using FastLED on pin 33 with 75 GRB LEDs, 5 V assumptions, pastel sparkles, and exponential fade-outs.
- [x] Validate locally by compiling/uploading with FastLED installed — compile step intentionally skipped per Scott's 2025-11-29 directive, but README documents the exact IDE/`arduino-cli` steps for the FireBeetle 2 ESP32-P4 (ESP32P4 Dev Module profile) when someone runs it later.
