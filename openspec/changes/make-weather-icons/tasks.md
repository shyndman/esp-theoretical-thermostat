## Implementation

- [x] Extract atomic path constants from MDI source SVGs into Python module
  - [x] `CLOUD_FULL` from `cloudy.svg`
  - [x] `CLOUD_WITH_GAP` from `lightning.svg`
  - [x] `BOLT` from `lightning.svg`
  - [x] `RAIN_DROP` from `rainy.svg`
  - [x] `SNOWFLAKE` from `snowy.svg`
- [x] Extract question badge from Google Material Symbols (not MDI)
  - [x] Source: filled circle with question mark, viewBox 0 -960 960 960
  - [x] Transform to 11px diameter, positioned 1px from bottom-right edges
  - [x] Add 13px background circle as halo/knockout effect
- [x] Create `scripts/compose_weather_icons.py` with uv script header
  - [x] Add `svgpathtools` dependency
  - [x] Implement `transform_path()` for scale + translate
  - [x] Implement `compose()` function for combining elements
  - [x] Implement `write_svg()` to output 24x24 SVG files
- [x] Define icon compositions in script
  - [x] 4 direct copies (breezy, light-sleet, mist, haze)
  - [x] 4 aliases (mostly-cloudy-day/night, drizzle, flurries)
  - [x] 12 composed icons (10 possible-* + 2 sleet variants)
- [x] Manually create/edit icons not suitable for composition
  - [x] precipitation, light-rain, heavy-rain
  - [x] light-snow, heavy-snow
  - [x] mostly-clear-day, mostly-clear-night (used simpler icons - composition too busy)
  - [x] dangerous-wind (required boolean operations in Inkscape)
  - [x] smoke (Google Material smoke trails, manually positioned)
- [x] Visual validation of all icons
- [x] Add `__pycache__/` to `.gitignore`
