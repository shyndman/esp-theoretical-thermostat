# Tasks
- [x] Add `CONFIG_THEO_LED_ENABLE` plus `CONFIG_THEO_LED_STRIP_GPIO` Kconfig entries (with sdkconfig defaults; GPIO 33 baseline) so labs can disable LEDs entirely and boards can pick the correct strip data pin.
- [x] Build the shared quiet-hours helper in `thermostat/application_cues.c` (public header + API described in design.md) so it owns the neutral quiet window math (`CONFIG_THEO_QUIET_HOURS_START/END_MINUTE`), SNTP gate, and WARN logging while enforcing checks strictly at request time.
- [x] Migrate existing audio boot logic (`audio_policy_check`, quiet math) to the new helper so boot/failure tones rely exclusively on the shared API and inherit the new config names.
- [x] Integrate the helper into the LED path: the low-level `thermostat_leds_*` primitives must bypass the helper only until `time_sync_wait_for_sync(0)` reports success (or boot ends without sync) and must call it before arming timers thereafter, aborting requests immediately when the helper denies output.
- [x] Implement a `thermostat_leds` service that owns the `led_strip` handle (RMT backend, 3 RGBW pixels), caps updates to single RGB fills (white channel pinned off), cancels any running timer when new effects arrive, and offers `pulse(color, hz)`, `solid_with_fade(color, 100ms)` and `off_with_fade(100ms)` behaviors.
- [x] Define a higher-level LED status controller that maps booting, booted, heating, and cooling events onto the service calls with the specified colors, fade profiles, and pulse rates (skip fan-only indication), ensures it initializes before the display stack, and wires `mqtt_dataplane` to call the LED hook alongside `thermostat_update_hvac_status_group()`.
- [x] Update boot + HVAC flows to trigger the controller at the right times, document quiet-hours coverage (emphasizing request-time suppression), and validate (`idf.py build` + hardware) that LEDs obey the shared gate and sequences end-to-end; capture steps in `docs/manual-test-plan.md`.
